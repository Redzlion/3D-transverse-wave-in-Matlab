# Numerical-Methods
Numerical Methods problems related to computer science.
Create an animation (3D) that represents the motion of a transverse wave. The curve of the wave is given by the formula $z=sin(x+y)$ and propagates at a speed of $V$.
Points for which $y>0$ should be colored light blue, and points for which $y<0$ should be colored dark blue.
Set the constraints on the z-axis to [-5.5].
